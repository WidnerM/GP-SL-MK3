All behavior of the SL MK3 extention is determined by named widgets within a GigPerformaer Rackspace
	Upon a Rackspace being activated the extension will scan all widgets in the rackspace (local and global)
	The "Advanced" tab of each GP widget has a field called "OSC/GPScript Name" that will be used to determine whether the extension will monitor the widget
		If the OSC/GPScript Name begins with "sl_" the extension will monitor it
	
Widgets that will be utilized up by this extention must be named in the format:
	sl_[type]_[bank ID]_[position]
	sl_[type]_[bank ID]_i
	sl_[type]_[bank ID]_[position]_p

Valid [type] fields are:
	k for knobs, in banks of 8
	b for buttons, in banks of 16
	p for pads, in banks of 16
	f for faders, in banks of 8

The "bank ID" field is used to identify different banks of each type:
	This is a text field that is used internally
	A simple example may help to illustrate the widget naming structure:
		Imagine you want three different banks of knob controls:  Reverb, Volume, Pan
			Knob widgets for reverb control would be named "sl_k_reverb_0" "sl_k_reverb_1" ... "sl_k_reverb_7"
			Knob widgets for volume control would be named "sl_k_volume_0" etc.
			Knob widgets for pan control would be named "sl_k_pan_0" etc.
			One bank at a time will be assigned to the 8 knobs at the top of the SL MK3
				The position of each knob on the SL MK3 display will track the associated widget
				The widget caption of each knob will appear on the first line above the knob image on the display
				The value will display on the second line above the knob
	When the bank_up and bank_down buttons are pressed the active bank will rotate through the available banks in alphabetical sort order
	Bank selection will "wrap around" when the first or last bank is reached

Each bank of controls has an associated "_i" widget that defines the color(s) and names to display on the SL MK3 screens
	Text widgets in GP are generally the most useful for these
		The Caption of the widget will appear on the SL MK3 display, showin in the form of "top line_bot line"
			The text color alpha property can be set to 0 so that the label text is not visible on the GP screen
		These _i widgets can be useful for visual feedback on the GigPerformer screen showing which bank is active
		When a bank is active the SL MK3 extention will set its value (effectively brightness) to 1 to raise its visibility in GP
			Non-active bank indicators will have their value (brightness) set to 0.3 to reduce their visibility

	Color information for the bank is taken from the "Fill Color" property of the "_i" widgets
		e.g., to have a knob bank with the bank ID "volume" display as green, create a shape widget "sl_k_volume_i" and set its fill color to green in GigPerformer
		The extention will use the RGB channel information of the widget to set the color on the SL MK3 display
		If you do not want these widgets to show on the GP screen you may set the "Hide" property of the widget (which is often done if using Text widgets for this)
		
	The caption field of the GP widget will contain two lines of text information for knob and button banks
		Captions contain two text fields of up to 9 characters separated by "_" and will display on the rightmost LCD display
			e.g., a widget named "sl_b_solomute_i" with a caption of "Solo_Mute" would display text of "Solo" next to the top button row and "Mute" near the bottom row

	The up/down arrows to the left of the LCDs cycle through knob banks
	The up/down arrows to the right of the buttons cycle through button banks
		The colors of the up and down arrows correspond the the colors of the next/previous banks

The "_p" widgets are optional and contain additional parameters for individual widgets
	For knob widgets:
		Knob color will be picked up from the GP widget Fill Color and override the bank default defined by the bank's _i widget
		Knob label will be taken from the _p widget Caption and override the knob default defined by the knob widget caption
		If a knob _p widget caption contains an integer parameter after a "_" delimiter it will be used as the knob resolution (higher numbers for finer resolution, default 1000)
	For buttons and pads:
		The _p widget Fill Color will be used for the On color (overriding the bank default of the _i widget)
		The widget Outline Color will be used for the Off color (overriding the bank default)
		For buttons, the _p GP widget caption will display momentarily at the bottom of the rightmost LCD display when a button is toggled
	If no _p widget exists for a knob or button then color information will be inherited from the _i widget for the bank
