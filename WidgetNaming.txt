Novation SL MK3 Extension for GigPerformer

Some system functions are built in and assigned to SL MK3 keys.  These include:
	Play:						Play transport key
	Stop:						Stop transport key
	Toggle Setlist Mode:		Clear key (toward lower left) - toggles GP in and out of SetList mode
	Toggle Racks/Variation:		Grid button will toggle between selecting Racks/Variation or Songs/Songparts depending on mode
	Page Racks/Songs/etc:		Left and Righ arrows at bottom left will page forard and backward through Songs/Racks/Variation/Songparts
	The 8 buttons below displays will select Song/Songpart/Rack/Variation depending on mode


Most behavior of the SL MK3 extention is determined by named widgets within a GigPerformaer Rackspace
	Upon a Rackspace being activated the extension will scan all widgets in the rackspace (local and global)
	The "Advanced" tab of each GP widget has a field called "OSC/GPScript Name" that will be used to determine whether the extension will monitor the widget
		If the OSC/GPScript Name begins with "sl_" the extension will monitor it
	
Widgets that will be utilized up by this extention must be named in the format:
	sl_[type]_[bank ID]_[position]

Valid [type] fields are:
	k for knobs, in banks of 8
	b for buttons, in banks of 16
	p for pads, in banks of 16
	f for faders, in banks of 8

The "bank ID" field is used to identify different banks of each type:
	This is a text field that is used internally
	Example: Controls for an 8 channel mixer where volume and pan can both be controlleed by knobs
		Widgets for volume control could be named "sl_k_volume_0" "sl_k_volume_1" ... "sl_k_volume_7"
			note - I generally make volume controls as faders in the GP panel view, but attach them to knobs for the SL MK3 because the physical faders are not motorized
		Widgets for pan control could be named "sl_k_pan_0" ... "sl_k_pan_7"
		One bank at a time will be assigned to the 8 knobs at the top of the SL MK3
			The position of each knob on the SL MK3 display will track the associated widget
			The widget caption of each knob will appear on the first line above the knob image on the display
			The value will display on the second line above the knob
	When the bank_up and bank_down buttons are pressed (arrows the the left of the MK3 display) the active bank will rotate through the available banks in alphabetical sort order
	Bank selection will "wrap around" when the first or last bank is reached

Two additional groups of widgets (typically GP text widgets, often hidden) control the colors or other characteristics of the widgets on the SL MK3 surface
	sl_[type]_[bank ID]_i    {"indicator" widgets}
	sl_[type]p_[bank ID]_[position]     {"parameter" widgets}

Indicator widgets may be created for each bank of controls for three things:
		Note:  text widgets in GP are generally the most useful for these
		Naming e.g., "sl_k_volume_i" and "sl_k_pan_i"
	
	The Caption of the widget will appear on the rightmost SL MK3 display, shown in in the form of "top line_bottom line"
			e.g., "Solo_Mute" to display "Solo" next to the top button row, "Mute" next to the bottom row
			tip: widget text color alpha property can be set to 0 so that the label text is not visible on the GP screen, or the text widget can be hidden

	Color information for the bank is taken from the "Fill Color" property of the "_i" widgets
		e.g., to have our "volume" bank display as green, create a text widget "sl_k_volume_i" and set its fill color to green in GigPerformer
		The extention will use the RGB channel information of the widget Fill Color to set the RGB color on the SL MK3
		
	Indicator widgets can also be used for visual feedback on the GigPerformer screen to indicate which bank is currently actively linked to the SL MK3
		When a bank is active the extention will set its value (effectively brightness) to 1 to raise its visibility in GP
		Non-active bank indicators will have their value (brightness) set to 0.3 to reduce their visibility
		tip: a GP text widget with a white border and text color alpha set to zero can act on the GP rackspace screen as a "region backlight" to indicate which controls are "active"

"Parameter" widgets are optional and contain additional parameters for individual widgets (generally using text widgets that are hidden)
	For knob widgets:
		Knob color will be picked up from the GP parameter widget Fill Color (and override the bank default defined by the bank's _i widget)
		Bar color above the knob will be taken from GP parameter widget Outline Color (and override the default)
		Knob label will be taken from the p widget Caption and override the knob default defined by the knob widget caption
		If a knob p widget caption contains an integer parameter after a "_" delimiter it will be used as the knob resolution (higher numbers for finer resolution, default 1000)
			example:  "sl_kp_volume_0" ... "sl_kp_volume_7" can be used to set each knob color, caption, and resolution individually
	For buttons and pads:
		The p widget Fill Color will be used for the On color (overriding the bank default of the _i widget)
		The widget Outline Color will be used for the Off color (overriding the bank default)
		For buttons, the p GP widget caption will display momentarily at the bottom of the rightmost LCD display when a button is toggled
	If no p widget exists for a knob or button then color information will be inherited from the _i widget for the bank


The up/down arrows to the left of the LCDs cycle through knob banks
The up/down arrows to the right of the buttons cycle through button banks
The colors of the up and down arrows correspond the the colors of the next/previous banks
